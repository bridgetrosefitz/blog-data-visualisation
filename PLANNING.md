The task is to develop a React-based web application that uses our mock GraphQL API and visualises relationships between posts, topics and even users. 

This application is to be used by someone non-technical who is trying to understand trends in the community (e.g. what topics are popular or related, with who, when, etc) so it should be straightforward to use and interpret.
